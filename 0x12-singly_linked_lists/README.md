## What are Data structures?
Data structures, as the term implies, are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use, and create data, depending on the task at hand. If data is a plate of food, data structures are your utensils (algorithms would be how to effectively use those utensils in this analogy). Just as you will likely select a spoon to eat a bowl of soup rather than a knife, you will learn over time to select and properly use data structures which fit the nature of the data you are working with. When you begin learning basic data structures such as arrays and linked lists, you will start to conceptualize how data is stored, searched, and edited, and what these operations will contribute to the space/time complexity of your program at runtime (this will make more sense once you start to learn about Big O notation). As you continue to learn more complex data structures, you may notice that you need to think more abstractly and deliberately in order to properly implement them. But with patience and practice you will begin to see patterns emerge that will allow you to intuitively see which situation calls for which data structure, just as you know to pick up a spoon when you see a bowl of soup.

Singly linked lists

In this project, I learned about implementing linked list data structures in C.

Files All of the following files are programs written in C:

0-print_list.c Prints all the elements of a list_t list 1-list_len.c Returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list 2-add_node.c Adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list 3-add_node_end.c Adds a new node at the end of a list_t list 4-free_list.c Frees a list_t list 100-first.c Prints a message before main function is executed 101-hello_holberton.asm` Assembly code that prints Hello, Holberton only using printf function

Tasks: 0. Print list

0-print_list.c: C function that prints all the elements of a list_t list. If str is NULL, the function prints [0] (nil).

List length
1-list_len.c: C function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

Add node
2-add_node.c: C function that adds a new node at the beginning a of a list_t list. If the function fails - returns NULL. Otherwise - returns the address of the new element.

Add node at the end
3-add_node_end.c: C function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list_t list. If the function fails - returns NULL. Otherwise - returns the address of the new element.

Free list
4-free_list.c: C function that frees a list_t list.

The Hare and the Tortoise
100-first.c: C function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

Real programmers can write assembly code in any language
